By the time when I read the post on the [NodeSeek](https://www.nodeseek.com/post-160686-1), one bro shared his amazong feeling of this theme. And I also feel very good about it.

But the last time when I try to build a static blog based on hexo, I failed with no reason. So this time, I hestated.

And also, compare with WordPress or Halo, static blog is more light. Thanks to the providers like Cloudflare or Github Pages, we can upload our blog on their server without any worry about the cost of server, domain is still neccessary if you want custom.

Howerver, when I turly opened the repo of the owner of [FUWARI](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari), my heart stopped by its simple setting process. 

As you can image, this time I success. In the future and in this blog, I will share you with some tech, bio or some daily life. And I am sure that must be very fun!
